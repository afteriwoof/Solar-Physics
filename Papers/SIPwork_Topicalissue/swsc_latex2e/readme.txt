%%      The two sub-figures referenced in the swsc.tex template are of eps and 
%%      png type, respectively, in order to demonstrate the usepackages 
%%      {subfigure} and {epstopdf} and thus create pdf-only output 
%%
%%      If you want to use TexLive or MikTex together with a bibtex bibliography 
%%      file you may run Latex2e from the command line with the set of commands
%%          pdflatex -shell-escape swsc.tex
%%          bibtex swsc (do not include the extension .tex)
%%          pdflatex -shell-escape swsc.tex
%%          pdflatex -shell-escape swsc.tex
%%
%%      A double call to pdflatex after calling bibtex is necessary in order to
%%      set citations and references correctly and insure that foreward/backward  
%%      linkage (backref option) is properly applied
%%      If you use MikTex you may need to issue a triple call to pdflatex
%%
%%      If you are using TexLive or MikTex but not a bibtex type of bibliography
%%      you may simply run Latex2e twice from the command line 
%%          pdflatex -shell-escape swsc.tex
%%          pdflatex -shell-escape swsc.tex
